# HTML Best Editor To Use When Learning

A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML.

Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors like VS Code.

When learning HTML, however, a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) and TextEdit (Mac) are highly recommended.

## Step 1: Open Notepad

Open the start screen (The Windows symbol at the bottom left of your screen). Type **Notepad**.

## Step 2: Write the HTML code

Write or copy the following HTML code into Notepad:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Emmanuel Enzeyi Heading</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Emmanuel Enzeyi</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 3: Save the HTML Page

Save the HTML Page.

Select **File >> Save As** in the Notepad.

Name the file **index.html** and set the encoding to **UTF-8** (The preferred encoding for HTML files).
