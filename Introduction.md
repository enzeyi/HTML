# INTRODUCTION TO HTML

## What is HTML

- HTML is an abbreviation for **Hyper Text Markup Language**
- HTML helps in creating the structure of a web page.
- HTML consists of a series of elements. These elements are used to determine how to display the content within a web page.

## Sample HTML Document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>First Heading</h1>
<p>First Paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML Elements descriptions
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declaration to define that this document is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: This is where the meta information about the HTML page is included.
- `<title>`: This is used to specify the title for the HTML page. The one that we see on the browser's title bar or pages tab.
- `<body>`: defines the document's body. This is the container for all the visible contents like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables, etc.
- `<h1>`: defines a large heading.
- `<p>`: defines a paragraph.

## HTML Elements
An HTML element contains a start tag, some content, then finally an end tag.

```
<tagname>Content Here</tagname>
```

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

## HTML empty tags
Some HTML elements do not have content, like the `<br>` element. We call them empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag as well.

## Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, etc., is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

The browser does not display the HTML tags but uses them to determine how to display the document.

## Visualization of an HTML Page Structure
The content inside the `<body>` section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the `<title>` element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
